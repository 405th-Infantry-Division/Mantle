# Introduction
The 405th Infantry Division (hereafter referred to as “the 405th,” “organization” or possessive pronouns) is the world’s premiere Halo® based costuming organization. Our members enjoy, express, and share their interest in costuming with others in the fan community by creating and wearing costumes and props that represent characters from the Halo® universe, which includes but is not limited to Halo-based video games, books, comics, and television shows. Our organization was founded in 2005 as an online message board to help fans create the complex costumes and props seen in the Halo® universe and in 2014 expanded its scope to become a costuming fan club.

With respect to Microsoft's "Game Content Usage Rules," our members hold no rights to the characters they portray and recognize it is a privilege to wear these costumes. We are not endorsed by Microsoft and do not reflect the views or opinions of Microsoft or anyone officially involved in producing or managing Halo®. As such, we, as an organization, do not currently contribute to the official narrative of the Halo® universe.

We also acknowledge that while in costume we are unofficial representatives the Halo® universe and as such accept the responsibility to behave professionally and tastefully while in public.

The 405th Infantry Division is wholly owned by Movie Prop Sites, LLC. It is operated by Movie Prop Sites, LLC as well as volunteer members from the community.

This Mantle serves to define what the 405th is, what it shall be, and to set down guidelines for the operations within our costuming fan club.

# Our Values
We hold three core values:

1. **UNITY:** We value every member and the bond of community they collectively create.
2. **ARMOR:** We value the enduring passion and attention to detail our members pour into the creation of their costumes.
3. **HONOR:** We value not only honor among our members, but honoring and celebrating the fictional universe of Halo®.

# Our Mission
We promote the development of artistic skill and the honing of artistic talent through the creation of Halo® costumes and props. We accomplish this by providing makers and cosplayers a global community in which they can share their knowledge and experience, which in turn nurtures and sustains their passion for the Halo® universe.

# Article I. Membership

# Article II. Organizational Units
The 405th is divided into 3 main units: Division, Regiment and Battalion. Most activity will be conducted at the local and regional level with the Division Staff serving as an administrate body.

## Battalion
Battalions are small regionally based organizational unit, covering “local” geographic areas such as a State in the US, or a Country internationally.

A Battalion consists of a minimum of five (5) Deployed members and is administrated by an elected Battalion Commanding Office (BCO). Battalions are responsible for holding member meetings, providing Deployed Members with events, and carrying out the policy prescribed in the 405th Mantle as well as those passed down by the Division Staff.

Member affiliation with a Battalion is normally based upon geographical boundaries and the member's primary residence. A member can request to be placed in another Battalion if they feel closer to that Battalion and it is more feasible to regularly attend events with that Battalion. If approved by the BCO of the member's original Battalion as well as the adopting Battalion's BCO, the member may switch Battalions.

A Battalion may only be formed within an existing Regiment.

Applicants for new Battalion status must complete the New Unit Application Form in which they list their new Battalion’s proposed name, proposed geographic region, roster of members from the existing Regiment, and a brief statement of purpose outlining the reasons for the Battalion to be formed.

Once submitted, the DMO will review the application and verify the membership status of the applicants. The DMO will then present the application to the DCO for final approval.

If approved by the DCO, the new Battalion undergoes a six month probationary period, during which it must demonstrate that it can operate as an independent body. After the six month period, the Division Staff will vote to approve the Battalion officially.

Battalion Commanding Officers are free to adopt reasonable local policies and procedures in accordance with the 405th Mantle as needed, so long as they are supported by the local membership and do not conflict with the letter or intent of the 405th’s policies and procedures. A BCO is free to appoint additional administrative staff and delegate duties (to those willing to accept those duties) as needed.

Battalions that fall under five (5) members will have a grace period of one year to return the membership level to or above the minimum. Battalions that fail to retain the minimum required membership level may be subject to losing Battalion status and may be placed in a Suspended status.

Battalion Commanding Officers report to their Regiment Commanding Officer.

A list of 405th Battalions and their boundaries is maintained by the Division Member Officer.

## Regiment
Regiments are large regionally based organizational units, covering broad geographic areas. Regiments typically consist of 3 or more Battalions, but may be maintained without any Battalions under them.

A new Regiment may be formed from 3 or more Battalions that geographically touch as long as the new Regiment doesn’t leave less than 25 members in the old Regiment.

Applicants for new Regiment status must complete the New Unit Application Form in which they list their new Regiment’s proposed name, proposed geographic region, roster of members from the existing Regiment, and a brief statement of purpose outlining the reasons for the Regiment to be formed.

Once submitted, the DMO will review the application and verify the membership status of the applicants. The DMO will then present the application to the DCO for final approval.

If approved by the DCO, the new Regiment undergoes a six month probationary period, during which it must demonstrate that it can operate as an independent body. After the six month period, the Division Staff will vote to approve the Regiment officially.

Regiment Commanding Officers are free to adopt reasonable policies and procedures in accordance with the 405th Mantle as needed, so long as they are supported by the local membership and do not conflict with the letter or intent of the 405th’s policies and procedures. A RCO is free to appoint additional administrative staff and delegate duties (to those willing to accept those duties) as needed.

Regiments that fall under ten (10) members will have a grace period of one year to return the membership level to or above the minimum. Regiments that fail to retain the minimum required membership level may be subject to losing Regiment status and may be placed in a Suspended status.

Regiment Commanding Officers report to the Division and oversee the Battalions within them.

A list of 405th Regiments and their boundaries is maintained by the Division Member Officer.

# Article VII. Disciplinary Action
The 405th’s standards of conduct exist to provide a consistent representation of the organization to the outside world and to provide a level of protection to its members from abuse and misconduct. To this end, the 405th adheres to the following prescription for disciplinary action.

All Commanding Officers are expected to enforce the rules of the 405th in their respective jurisdictions. Any member behaving in an unacceptable manner or violating 405th rules (in letter or intent) or the tenets thereof is subject to disciplinary action. Disputes within any 405th subdivision are to be managed by the Commanding Officer of the subdivision, unless the Commanding Officer is involved in the dispute or there is any other clear conflict of interest on their part, in which case the dispute must be escalated to the next level.

Complaints should be directed by members to their immediate Commanding Officer. The Commanding Offer is responsible for mediating the dispute. Mediation may take the form of an informal meeting between the parties in which the Commanding Officer presides, up to formal hearings in which the DJO presides. If a dispute appears that it will ultimately require a formal hearing, the DJO must be notified as soon as possible so they can observe the proceedings or be otherwise included in communications related to the dispute prior to the formal meeting.

In the event a conflict or complaint involves members of different units, the Commanding Officer of the primary complainant serves as the presiding officer and conducts a meeting with the defendant and the Commanding Officer of the defendant's unit. Again, if a formal hearing is required or if one of the parties involved in a dispute is an officer of a unit, the hearing will be overseen by the DJO or a designated representative.

All hearings are conducted on the 405th forum, unless otherwise directed by the DJO.

No member may be removed from the 405th without the knowledge and approval of the DCO.

Following the resolution of a dispute or hearing, members have the right to appeal the decision to the DCO within 30 days. Any judgment by the DCO following an appeal is final.

# Article VIII. Legal

The dispute shall then be arbitrated by a single arbitrator pursuant to the Commercial Rules of the Association at the Association office in Delaware. In the disposition of the dispute, the arbitrator shall be governed by the express terms of the Mantle and otherwise by the laws of the State of Delaware which shall govern the interpretation of the Mantle. In all such matters, only the substantive laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the conflicts of laws thereof shall apply in any proceedings involving the 405th. In no event shall the substantive laws of any other jurisdiction have any application in any legal proceeding involving the 405th. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and conclusive on the parties and shall be a bar to any suit, action or proceeding instituted in any federal, state or local court or before any administrative tribunal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, judgment on any award by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. This arbitration provision shall survive any expiration or termination of the Mantle.

## Failure to Comply

Subject to the limitations on indemnification set forth in this Rule, or otherwise imposed by applicable law, the 405th shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, now or hereafter in effect, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative by reason of the fact that he or she is or was an officer of the 405th, or is or was an officer of the 405th serving at the request of the 405th as a director, trustee, or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the 405th, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful; provided, however, the 405th shall be required to indemnify an officer in connection with an action, suit or proceeding initiated by such person only if such action, suit or proceeding was authorized by the Division Staff. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea or nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the 405th, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable

1.2. No Indemnification Where Found Liable. Subject to the limitations on indemnification set forth in this Rule, or otherwise imposed by applicable law, the 405th shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the 405th to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was an officer of the 405th, or is or was an officer of the 405th serving at the request of the 405th as a director, trustee, or officer of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or settlement or such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the 405th; except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the 405th unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court shall deem proper.

1.3. Determination by Division Staff. Any indemnification under this Rule (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the 405th only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of officer is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Rule. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Division Staff by a majority vote of such officers who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding (even if such majority vote constitutes less than a quorum), or (ii) if the majority vote of such officers so directs (even if such majority vote constitutes less than a quorum), upon receipt from independent legal counsel of a written opinion that such indemnification is reasonable, or (iii) by the members of the 405th by resolution of the Regional Conclave. To the extent however, that an officer of the 405th has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding described above, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith, without the necessity of authorization in the specific case.

1.4. Good Faith Defined. For purpose of any determination under this Rule, a person shall be deemed to have acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the 405th, or, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, to have had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, if his action is based on the records or books of account of the 405th or another enterprise, or on information supplied to him or her by the officers of the 405th or another enterprise in the course of their duties, or on the advice of legal counsel for the 405th or another enterprise or on information or records given or reports made to the 405th or another enterprise by an independent certified public accountant or by an appraiser or other expert selected with reasonable care by the 405th or another enterprise. The term “another enterprise” as used in this Rule shall mean any corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise of which such person is or was serving at the request of the 405th as a director or officer. The provisions of this Rule shall not be deemed to be exclusive or to limit in any way the circumstances in which a person may be deemed to have met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Rule, except however, that a resolution of the Division Staff shall be conclusive of whether or not such person acted in a manner which is or was opposed to the best interests of the 405th.

1.5. Expenses Payable in Advance. Expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by the officer in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the 405th in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the 405th as authorized in this Rule.

1.6. Non-exclusivity of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to this Rule shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under agreement, contract, vote of members, or the Division Staff or pursuant to the direction (howsoever embodied) of any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, it being the policy of the 405th that indemnification of the persons specified in this Rule shall be made to the fullest extent permitted by law. The provisions of this Rule shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of any person who is not specified in this Rule but whom the 405th has the power or obligation to indemnify.

1.7. Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Rule, references to “the 405th” shall include, in addition to the incorporated association domiciled in the State of North Carolina which is generally the 405th, any resulting corporation or successor unincorporated association wherever incorporated or domiciled, any constituent entity thereof (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors or officers, so that any person who is or was a director or officer of such constituent entity, or is or was a director or officer of such constituent entity serving at the request of such constituent entity serving at the request of such constituent entity as a director or officer of a corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Rule with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued. For purposes of this Rule, references to “fines” shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and references to “serving at the request of the 405th” shall include any service as a director or officer of the 405th which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director or officer with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner “not opposed to the best interests of the 405th” as referred to in this Rule. For the purposes of this Rule, an “officer” of the 405th, including without limitation an “executive officer” or “director” of the 405th, shall include, by way of example but without limitation, all advisers, commissioners or other volunteer positions appointed from time-to-time by the Division Staff, including those full-time employees of the 405th described as “directors” or “managers” in their job title. “Executive officers” and “directors” shall each include by way of example but without limitation, the elected officers of the 405th incumbent in the offices of the Division Staff.

1.8. Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Rule shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or executive officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

1.9. Limitation on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Rule to the contrary, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification (which shall be governed by the applicable provisions of this Rule and generally by the Rules with respect to Disputes), the 405th shall not be obligated to indemnify any director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person unless such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized or consented to by the Division Staff of the 405th. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any indemnification under this Rule shall be subordinate to the policies of insurance applicable to the defense of any acts or omissions giving rise to any claim resulting in possible indemnification under this Rule.

# Article IX. Amendments
A committee, supervised by the DJO, and consisting of the Division Staff and the Regiment Commanding Officers oversee and manage amendments to the Mantle. This committee is called the Mantle Review Committee (MRC).

Amendments and alterations to the Mantle may be proposed by official 405th members to their Commanding Officer who will in turn pass it up until it reaches the DJO. Proposals may be submitted by 405th members to the MRC at any time during the year. The MRC may also work on proposals at any time throughout the year and have no time constraints upon which a proposal must be addressed.

The DJO will submit the proposal to the MRC which will review and potentially revise the proposal. Upon reaching a satisfactory state of completion of the proposal, signified by passing a majority vote by the Division Staff (Regiment Commanding Officers do not vote), the proposal becomes an Amendment and is effective immediately.

The MRC, at its discretion, may reject proposals deemed inappropriate or contradictory to the spirit of the organization.
